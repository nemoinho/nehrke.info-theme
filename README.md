# Theme for nehrke.info
This is minimal hugo-theme which is heavily inspired by [Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde), an excellent two-column theme for hugo.

## Fonts
The fonts which are used in this theme are [Fredericka the Great](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredericka+the+Great) for the page-title and [PT Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans) for basically everything else.
Since I already know the used letters for my headline I use only the minimal combination of letters needed in the case of Fredericka the Great.

## Icons
The icons are originated from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) and used as their SVG-Variant within the CSS.

## Usage
The theme can be used like any other hugo-theme just by including it to the themes-directory.
